    <h1>Synopsis</h1>
      <p>
      The entire story is told in the second person, except for one moment where Tackman is reading and Aunt May asks him what
      he is reading. The text reads "He shut the book."
      </p>
      <p>
      Tackman (Tack, Tackie) is a young boy with a drug-addict mother who lives in a big house by the Atlantic Ocean. He
      gets his mother's lover (Jason) to get him a pulp fiction book from the drug store. The characters in the book come to
      life as Tack navigates a costume party where he happens upon Dr. Black (who wants to marry his mama) administering drugs
      to mama via a syringe. This tableau reminds him of a scene in the book, where Dr. Death is conducting an experiment
      on Talar. Tack runs next door and gets the neighbor to call the police.
      </p>
      <p>
      Later, the police tell Tack that Dr. Black was just trying to help his mother, and try to get Tack to tell them who
      gave mama amphetamines, but he doesn't know. Dr. Death appears and Tack says he doesn't want to finish the book
      because Dr. Death will die. Dr. Death is touched, and reassures Tack that if he starts it over, they'll all be there again.
      The story concludes with Dr. Death telling Tackie that Tackie is the same way.

    <h1>Questions</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>Is the switch from "you" to "he" when Aunt May asks what Tackman is reading intentional or an error? If intentional,
          it is very similar to a trick Wolfe used in the Short Sun books, abruptly changing the person used by the narrator.</li>
        <li>What is the meaning of "The House of 31 February?" February has 28 days, 29 in a leap year. It carries a
          suggestion of something carried on too long. Is there an association with March 3?</li>
        <li>Why can some people see the fictional characters?</li>
        <li>Why does Tack's age and height change in different ways with different characters? He seems to be oldest/tallest
        with Ransom, then almost as tall as Talar. He doesn't get any older or taller with Dr. Death.</li>
        <li>What do the Dr. Death/Dr. Black parallels mean?</li>
        <li>What does Dr. Death mean when he says "it's the same with you" to Tackie? Is this a fourth-wall-breaking
          acknowlegement that Tackie is also a character in a story? Dr. Death also tells Tack that Ransom and he are just
          playing roles -- that they're like wrestlers in a show. This feels like an adult telling a child something
          important.</li>
        <li>What is the importance of Tackie knowing that his name is written in the sand and will be erased?</li>
        <li>What is Wolfe saying about drugs? Dr. Death uses them to debase or elevate creatures, mama and the tripping
          girl use them recreationally, Dr. Black uses them to heal (maybe), and the novel comes from a drugstore.</li>
      </ul>
